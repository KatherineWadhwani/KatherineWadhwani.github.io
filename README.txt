Project by Katherine Wadhwani

Correctness and Troubleshooting;
To the best of my understanding, all parts of this project have been implemented correctly. The only issue I'm continuing to troubleshoot is in styling
resume.html, as the two columns start at different heights. The resume headings "skills" is also getting separated from the list. Interestingly, the format
is slightly different when I open index.html in a browser.

Collaboration:
I did not discuss the project with anyone.

Hours to Complete:
I took about 8 hours to complete the lab. Approximately 4 were spent creating the html/css sheets, and 4 to troubleshoot github.
