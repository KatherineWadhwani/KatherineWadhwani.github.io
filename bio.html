		<p> Graduating from the University of Washington in 2020, my academic training began in neuroscience. My 6 years of laboratory experience span Social Cognitive Development, Autism Spectrum Disorders, Dopamine Systems, and Electrophysiology. Most recently, while at the Loren Frank Lab, I worked on a project analyzing population activity of place cells in the rat hippocampus. Using computational modeling, we detected and potentially modified the recall of complex mental representations.

        <p> Using software, we were studying the underpinnings of perception. With real-time decoding of neural data and petabytes of continuous recording, I realized that technology permitted revolutionary insight into experience. As a second-year Computer Science Masterâ€™s student, I now have a strong foundation in back-end development, with particular expertise in Java and C++. I hope to combine my paths in a creative environment where software meets humanity.
